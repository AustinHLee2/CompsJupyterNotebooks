# CompsJupyterNotebooks
My Jupyter Notebooks used for CS comps Fall 2018

SteeringPlots.ipynb - used to compare NN driving output to my actual driving
visualize_attention.ipynb - overlays grad-CAM visualization on individual images or an array of images
keras-salient-object-visualisation.ipynb - stitches images to create a video with salient-object-visualisation. Takes a long time and cannot download the resulting video, can only play the video in the notebook.
TrainDonkey.ipynb - ocassionaly used this to use Google Colab's GPU to accelerate my training, upload a file of .tar images, unzip it in the instance, and train the NN.
